Firefox fans rejoice: Mozilla Quantum is set to be released on Nov 14th, featuring a faster browser engine and less RAM consumption.

Download the BETA builds over here: [https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/quantum/](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/quantum/) .. or just wait for the Production release on November 14th.

Some performance tests the Mozilla conducted can be found on their official blog: [https://blog.mozilla.org/firefox/quantum-performance-test/](https://blog.mozilla.org/firefox/quantum-performance-test/)

> We have run a few tests to compare [Firefox Quantum](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/quantum/) (57)’s speed and memory as compared to previous versions of Firefox, and to Chrome. Results vary based on your computer and the apps you’re using, but Firefox Quantum is consistently about 2X faster than Firefox was.

Sidenote: I'm curious on how the existing Geckodriver will play along with the new browser architecture :)
