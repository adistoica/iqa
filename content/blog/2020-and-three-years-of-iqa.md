Hey guys,

As 2019 is coming to an end very fast, I know that you've been all busy testing your apps with your favorite tools.

As for myself, I've been really busy over the past month working on a new testcase management app, that will help you and your team simplify all of your testing processes and workflows.

More details will follow soon, so stay tuned also in 2020 for the exact release date.

I really hoped that you've enjoyed this year as much as a did, which was full of surprises and accomplishments.

Since 2020 marks three years of iQA, I wish you a Happy New Year!
