I recently came across a interesting topic that might be of interest to software developers or oven QA's: [Getting Things Done](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Getting_Things_Done "Getting Things Done"), which is a [time management](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_management "Time management") method that has multiple areas of application.

1. Capture
2. Clarify
3. Organize
4. Reflect
5. Engage

If you may have interest in this topic, you can find out more on the author's [website](http://gettingthingsdone.com/).
