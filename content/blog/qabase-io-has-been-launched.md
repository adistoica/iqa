Hello Testers and Developers!

I'm pretty thrilled to announce that we have launched [https://QAbase.io](https://QAbase.io) which is completely **FREE** to use for your team and company right now.

Here are some of the core features that our **Testcase Management Application** has:

- Organize your testing efforts with **Projects**
- Invite team members and collaborate in the same **Workspace**
- Create **Testcases** and run them using the built in **Executions** module
- Create **Defects** using the built in defect management system
- Use the built in **Metrics** and **Test Reports** to know at any point in time the state of your project's lifecycle
- Custom **integrations** with Slack and Github (and many more coming soon).

I encourage you to [sign-up](https://app.qabase.io/register) and give it a try!

Stay safe!
