Over the past year, I've been working with some various automation frameworks (for front-end testing) that are dedicated for AEM. Here is a short list that I've found:

\- **Bobcat** : [https://github.com/Cognifide/bobcat](https://github.com/Cognifide/bobcat)

\- **Hobbes.JS** : [https://helpx.adobe.com/experience-manager/6-3/sites/developing/using/reference-materials/test-api/index.html](https://helpx.adobe.com/experience-manager/6-3/sites/developing/using/reference-materials/test-api/index.html)

Both frameworks have advantages and disadvantages and I encourage you to test them both out.

Of course, you can create a test harness using your favorite framework, either if it's Selenium or any other tool that can use handle website front-end testing.
