Since yesterday, Mozilla pushed in the official update channel of Firefox (now version 51) the latest version of Developer Tools. Why is this so important? Because right now, the [Firebug](http://getfirebug.com/) extension is no longer supported. (\*ding\* to web developers and automation engineers)

As per the official blog post, you are invited to update to the last and greatest version.

> The Firebug extension isn't being developed or maintained any longer. We invite you to use the [Firefox DevTools](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Tools) instead, which [ship](https://blog.getfirebug.com/2016/02/08/merging-firebug-into-the-built-in-firefox-developer-tools/) with Firebug.next

Now, I'm still facing the issue where the [Firepath](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/firepath/) extension is now longer usable with the actual DevTools. A quick solution this topic is to disable the Electrolysis (e10) in the Firefox settings. More about that in a future post :)
