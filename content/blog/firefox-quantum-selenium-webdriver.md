summary: "Making sure that the latest Selenium Webdriver works with Firefox Quantum"
---

So last month, Firefox Quantum was released - as I previously announced. After 3 weeks of extensive testing, we can safely assume that is it **SAFE** for the most common operations and actions that are available in the Selenium JAVA library.

If you are feeling brave, you can update to the latest production versions (at the time of writing of this article):

- Selenium bindings: [3.8.1](https://goo.gl/hvDPsK)
- ChromeDriver: [2.33](https://sites.google.com/a/chromium.org/chromedriver/downloads)
- Geckodriver: [0.19.1](https://github.com/mozilla/geckodriver/releases)
- IEDriver: [3.8](http://selenium-release.storage.googleapis.com/index.html?path=3.8/)
