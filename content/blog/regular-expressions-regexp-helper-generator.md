I've just came across a new tool that you might find handy:

[https://regexr.com/](https://regexr.com/) - a nice online tool for generating regular expressions ;)

Keep in mind while using this:

> While the core feature set of regular expressions is fairly consistent, different implementations (ex. Perl vs Java) may have different features or behaviors.
>
> RegExr uses your browser's RegExp engine for matching, and its syntax highlighting and documentation reflect the JavaScript RegExp standard.
