I've recently came across an excellent list of command line tools from Jeroen Janssens [blog](http://jeroenjanssens.com/2013/09/19/seven-command-line-tools-for-data-science.html). You can use them to sort / list / organize your test results in order to store them in almost any reporting tool.

XMLStarlet is my favorite one so far, since I'm currently processing multiple XML files to generate valid test reports. More about that in a future blog post :)
